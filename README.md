# cpp_redis
cpp_redis is a C++11 Asynchronous Redis Client, with support for synchronous operations and pipelining.

Network is based on raw sockets API, making the library really lightweight.

## Requirements
* C++11
* Mac or Linux (no support for Windows platforms)

## Wiki
A [Wiki](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/wiki) is available and provides documentation for the library.

## Examples
Some examples are provided in this repository:
* [redis_client.cpp](examples/redis_client.cpp) shows how to use the redis client class.
* [redis_subscriber.cpp](examples/redis_subscriber.cpp) shows how to use the redis subscriber class.

These examples can also be found inside the [Wiki](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/wiki/Examples).
